# Prereq  Adding Hardhat Network to MetaMask

This guide will help you add the Hardhat local blockchain as a network in MetaMask and import an account from Hardhat.

## Step 1: Start Hardhat Node

Before adding the network, you need to start the Hardhat node. Open a terminal and run:
```sh
cd blockfoliodapp
npx hardhat node
```
This will start a local blockchain at `http://127.0.0.1:8545/` and generate several test accounts with private keys.

## Add Hardhat Network to MetaMask

1. Open **MetaMask** in your browser.
2. Click on your profile icon in the top-right corner and go to **Settings**.
3. Navigate to **Networks** and click **Add Network**.
4. Select **Add a Network Manually**.
5. Fill in the following details:
   - **Network Name:** Hardhat Localhost
   - **New RPC URL:** `http://127.0.0.1:8545/`
   - **Chain ID:** `31337`
   - **Currency Symbol:** ETH
   - **Block Explorer URL:** *(Leave empty)*
6. Click **Save**. The Hardhat network is now added to MetaMask.

### Step 2: Import a Hardhat Account into MetaMask

When you run `npx hardhat node`, it displays a list of test accounts along with their private keys. To import one:

1. Copy a private key from the Hardhat node output.
2. Open **MetaMask** and make sure you're on the **Hardhat Localhost** network.
3. Click on your account icon and select **Import Account**.
4. Paste the copied private key and click **Import**.
5. The account will now be available in MetaMask with preloaded test ETH.
